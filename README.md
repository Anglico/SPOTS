SPOTS
=====
The Simple Project Organizational Tool for Scanlation is a Project Management System (and more) designed specifically for use with scanlation.

Projects and Chapters
---------------------
Each series and oneshot is represented as a "Project". Administrators can easily add Projects and give it as little or as much information as they want; they can always go back and change the info later if they so wish.
Also note that each project can be assigned a Project Manager.

Each Project then holds inside of it "Chapters". Chapters are exactly what they sound like. This time, both the Administrators and the Project Manager for that Project can create and edit Chapters. Each Chapter will have a comment box for people working on the chapter to pass messages back and forth.

Project Management through "Tasks"
----------------------------------
Administrators and the Project Manager create "Tasks" within a Chapter. These Tasks consist of the usual stuff (Translation, Cleaning, etc). You then assign specific people (as many as you want) to each Task. Tasks are assigned a status (Not Started, In Progress, Stalled, Complete, etc) along with optional links to the completed work.

Automatic Project Page
----------------------
One of the goals of SPOTS is to provide an automatically updating Project Page. When you create or edit a Project, you are given an option to make that project "Public". Public Projects show up on the Project Page for guests to see when they visit your SPOTS installation.
